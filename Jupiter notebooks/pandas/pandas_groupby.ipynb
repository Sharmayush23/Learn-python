    "**Understanding `groupby()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose**: The `groupby()` method is a powerful tool for **analyzing data by grouping rows based on one or more categorical columns**. It allows you to perform aggregate operations on these groups.\n",
    "*   **Categorical Columns**: `groupby()` is typically applied on categorical columns, which contain data that can be divided into distinct groups or categories. Examples include genre, director, or actor.\n",
    "*   **Numerical Columns**: While grouping, numerical columns are typically used for applying aggregate functions after grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax and Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Grouping Data**:\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name')` or `df.groupby(['column_name1', 'column_name2'])`.\n",
    "    *   This step creates a **GroupBy object**, which represents the data grouped by the specified column(s).\n",
    "    *   When a single column name (string) is passed, the data is grouped based on the unique values of that column. When a list of column names is passed, data is grouped based on combinations of unique values across those columns.\n",
    "    *   For example, `movies.groupby('genre')` will group the movie data by unique genres. Similarly, `movies.groupby(['director', 'star_van'])` will group the data by unique combinations of directors and lead actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Applying Aggregate Functions**:\n",
    "    *   After grouping, you can apply aggregate functions to the grouped data. These functions perform calculations on numerical columns within each group.\n",
    "    *   Common aggregate functions include:\n",
    "        *   `sum()`: Calculates the sum of values.\n",
    "        *   `min()`: Finds the minimum value.\n",
    "        *   `max()`: Finds the maximum value.\n",
    "        *   `mean()` or `average()`: Calculates the average value.\n",
    "        *  `count()`: Counts the number of non-null values.\n",
    "        *   `std()`: Calculates the standard deviation.\n",
    "        *  `median()`: Calculates the median value.\n",
    "        *   `size()`: Returns the number of items in each group.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name')['numerical_column'].sum()` or `df.groupby('column_name')['numerical_column'].agg('sum')`.\n",
    "    *   You can apply different aggregate functions to different columns using a dictionary:\n",
    "        *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name').agg({'numerical_column1': 'sum', 'numerical_column2': 'mean'})`.\n",
    "        * You can also pass a list of functions to apply multiple aggregations to the same column:\n",
    "             *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name').agg({'numerical_column': ['min', 'max', 'mean']})`.\n",
    "    *   For example, `movies.groupby('genre')['imdb_rating'].mean()` will calculate the average IMDB rating for each movie genre.\n",
    "    *   If a column is not specified after groupby, the aggregation will be done on all the numerical columns of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Sorting Results**:\n",
    "    *   You can sort the results of a groupby operation using `sort_values()`.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name')['numerical_column'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)`\n",
    "    *   This will sort the results in descending order based on the aggregated values.\n",
    "    *   For example, to get the genres with the highest total gross income, you would first `groupby` 'genre', then take the `sum` of 'gross', then `sort_values`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Accessing Group Data**:\n",
    "    *   You can access specific groups using the `get_group()` method.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `grouped_data.get_group('group_name')`\n",
    "    *   This allows you to retrieve a DataFrame containing data for a specific group.\n",
    "    *   For example, `grouped_movies.get_group('Horror')` will give you a dataframe containing horror movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Looping Through Groups**:\n",
    "    * You can loop through groups of a groupby object.\n",
    "    * The syntax is `for group, data in df.groupby('column_name'):`.\n",
    "    * The `group` variable will hold the unique group name or combination of names, and the `data` variable will hold a dataframe containing rows for that particular group.\n",
    "    *  For example, this could be used to find the highest-rated movie in each genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Applying Custom Functions**:\n",
    "    *   You can use the `apply()` method to apply custom functions to each group.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `df.groupby('column_name').apply(custom_function)`\n",
    "    *   This enables complex data transformations specific to your data and analysis needs.\n",
    "    *   For example, you can define a function to count how many movies in each genre start with a particular letter, and apply it to each genre group.\n",
    "*   **`agg()` with Multiple Functions**:\n",
    "    *   The `agg()` function can apply different aggregate functions to different columns.\n",
    "    *   You can also apply a list of aggregate functions to the same column or different columns, allowing for flexible data summarization.\n",
    "*   **Split-Apply-Combine Strategy**:\n",
    "    *   The `apply()` method follows the split-apply-combine strategy, where the data is first split into groups (split), a custom logic is applied to each group (apply), and then the results are combined (combine).\n",
    "    *   This strategy allows for complex data transformations that are specific to grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific `groupby()` Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`first()`**: Returns the first item from each group.\n",
    "*   **`last()`**: Returns the last item from each group.\n",
    "*   **`nth()`**: Returns the nth item from each group.\n",
    "*   **`size()`**: Returns the number of rows in each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of use in the source**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   To find the top three genres that have the most gross earnings, you would first group the data by the 'genre' column, then calculate the sum of the 'gross' column, and finally sort the values in descending order.\n",
    "*   To find the genre with the highest average IMDB rating, you would group the data by 'genre', calculate the average IMDB rating, sort in descending order, and get the first result.\n",
    "*  To identify the director with the most votes, group by 'director', sum the 'number of votes' and sort the values in descending order.\n",
    "*   To find the number of movies done by each actor, group by the actor column and count the movies.\n",
    "*   To find the number of groups formed using the groupby operation, use the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The `groupby()` method is fundamental for performing group-wise operations in Pandas.\n",
    "*   It enables you to summarize and analyze data based on different categories or groups.\n",
    "*   It can be used in conjunction with various aggregate functions and custom functions for a wide range of analytical tasks.\n",
