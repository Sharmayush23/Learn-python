    "**Key Concepts of Pandas Series**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Definition**: A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. It's similar to a column in a table.\n",
    "*   **Components**: A Series object has two main components:\n",
    "    *   **Index**: Labels for each value in the Series. It can be automatically generated (numeric) or custom-defined.\n",
    "    *   **Values**: The actual data stored in the Series.\n",
    "*   **Data Types**: Series can hold various data types, and when strings are present, the data type is often shown as 'object'.\n",

    "*   **From a Python List**:\n",
    "    *   **Syntax**: `pd.Series(data, index=index_list, name='series_name')`\n",
    "    *   The `data` parameter is the list, `index` is an optional list of index labels, and `name` is an optional string for the series name.\n",
    "*   **From a Dictionary**:\n",
    "    *   **Syntax**: `pd.Series(dictionary, name='series_name')`\n",
    "    *   The keys of the dictionary become the index, and the values become the Series values.\n",

    "    *   **Syntax**: `pd.read_csv(filepath, index_col=index_column_name, squeeze=True)`\n",
    "    *   `filepath` is the path to the CSV file, `index_col` specifies which column to use for the index, and `squeeze=True` converts the result into a Series object.\n",

    "*   **`astype()`**: This method is used to **change the data type of a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.astype(dtype)`\n",
    "    *   Example: `vk.astype('int16')` changes the data type of the 'vk' Series to a 16-bit integer.\n",
    "    *   This can be useful to reduce the memory footprint of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`between()`**: This method checks if the values in a Series fall within a specified range.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.between(lower_bound, upper_bound)`\n",
    "    *   Example: `vk.between(51, 99)` returns a boolean series indicating where the values in 'vk' are between 51 and 99.\n",
    "    *   The bounds are inclusive.\n",
    "    *   This can be combined with other methods such as `size()` to count the number of values that meet the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`clip()`**: This method **limits values in a Series to a specified range**.\n",
    "    *  Syntax: `series.clip(lower_bound, upper_bound)`\n",
    "    *  Example: `series.clip(100, 200)` replaces all values below 100 with 100, and all values above 200 with 200, while values in between remain unchanged.\n",
    "    *   This method is not as useful as `between()` according to the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`drop_duplicates()`**: This method **removes duplicate values from a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.drop_duplicates(keep='first' or 'last')`\n",
    "    *   By default, `keep='first'`, which keeps the first occurrence of a duplicate and removes the others.\n",
    "    *   Setting `keep='last'` will keep the last occurrence and remove the earlier duplicates.\n",
    "    *   Example:  `temp_series.drop_duplicates()` would remove all but the first occurrence of each value in `temp_series`.\n",
    "    *   It is important to note that this method can significantly reduce the size of a dataset by removing repeated entries.\n",
    "     *   If a Series of movie actors' names has duplicate names and you use `drop_duplicates()`, you will be left with only the unique names.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`duplicated()`**: This method identifies **duplicate values in a Series, returning a boolean Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.duplicated()`\n",
    "    *   The boolean series indicates `True` for values that are duplicates and `False` for unique values.\n",
    "    *   Example: `series.duplicated()` returns `False` for the first occurrence of a value and `True` for subsequent occurrences.\n",
    "    *   You can use `.sum()` on the resulting boolean Series to get the total number of duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **`size`**: This is an attribute that returns the **total number of elements in a Series, including any missing values**.\n",
    "    * Syntax: `series.size`\n",
    "    * This attribute can be used to determine the number of elements in a series.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`count()`**: This method returns the **number of non-missing values in a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.count()`\n",
    "    *   It will not include null or NaN values in the total count.\n",
    "    *    This can be used to find the number of values that are not missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`isnull()`**: This method **checks for missing values in a Series, returning a boolean Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.isnull()`\n",
    "    *   It returns `True` for missing values and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "     *   You can use `.sum()` on the resulting boolean Series to get the total number of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`fillna()`**: This method is used to **fill missing values in a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.fillna(value)`\n",
    "    *   Example: `series.fillna(0)` will replace all missing values with 0.\n",
    "    *   You can fill missing values with a specific number, the mean value, or any other logic.\n",
    "    *   Example: `temp.fillna(temp.mean())` will fill missing values with the mean of the non-missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`isin()`**: This method **checks if values in a Series are present in a list (or another Series)**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.isin(list)`\n",
    "    *   It returns a boolean Series where `True` indicates the value exists in the provided list, and `False` if it doesn't.\n",
    "    *   Example: `vk.isin()` returns a boolean Series, which indicates if any values in the series are either 49 or 99.\n",
    "    *   This method allows you to apply multiple checks at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`apply()`**: This method **applies a function to each value in a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.apply(function)`\n",
    "    *   It can apply any custom logic using a lambda function or a pre-defined function.\n",
    "    *   Example: `movies['actors'].apply(lambda x: x.split().upper())` takes each actor's name, splits it into words, takes the first word, and converts it to uppercase.\n",
    "    *   This is a very powerful function to apply complex logic or transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`copy()`**: This method **creates a deep copy of a Series**.\n",
    "    *   Syntax: `series.copy()`\n",
    "    *   When you slice a series or get the head or tail, you are working with a view, not a copy. Changes in a view reflect in the original data. Using `copy()` creates a separate copy so that modifications do not affect the original data.\n",
    "    *   Example:  `new_series = vk.head(5).copy()` creates a new series of the first 5 elements of `vk` so that if you modify `new_series`, the original `vk` will not be changed.\n",
    "    *   It is important to use `copy()` when you intend to modify a subset of the original series, to avoid accidental changes to the original data.\n",
